# Helio Materialiser

Helio materialiser allows to generate RDF from heterogeneous sources of data. The generated RDF can be accessed (retrieving the dataset, accessing a resource, or solving a SPARQL query) or it can be injected automatically by Helio into an existing triplestore. Furthermore, the RDF can be generated synchronously under demand, or asynchronously with a timer.
